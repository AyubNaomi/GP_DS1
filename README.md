# GP_DS1 - Predicting COVID-19 Hospitalization Risks Using Data Science Models

## Group Members
- Naomi Ayub (1868128)
- Elyjaiah Durden (1977092)
- Nirmal John (2052312)

## Requirements

To run the forecasting notebook:

/bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels


## Project Overview
This project explores COVID-19 data provided by Our World in Data (OWID) to:
- Analyze pandemic trends.
- Predict ICU admission needs using time series forecasting models.
- Classify hospitalization risk levels using machine learning models.

Each group member handled one major task:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Nirmal John
- **Time Series Forecasting (ICU Admissions):** Elyjaiah Durden
- **Classification Modeling (Hospitalization Risk):** Naomi Ayub

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
   - statsmodels
3. Open the notebooks (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, or any Jupyter-compatible environment.
4. Run each notebook cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Notes
- All data preprocessing steps (handling missing values, feature creation) are included in each notebook.
- Forecasting models and classification models were selected based on project goals and rubric guidelines.
- All plots and figures used in the final report can be regenerated by running the notebooks.
